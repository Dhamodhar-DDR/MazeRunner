# Game Project Report
### Project Name: 
Maze Runner 
### Project Idea:
This project describes the process involved in making a 3-D maze graphical computer game with the help of Unity3D.

### Tech Stack:
* Unity3D - For Game designing and development
* C# - For Scripting

### Progress of the project:
Most of the part which I have tought to complete before starting the project has been completed except two things.
* Adding a story line with cutscenes.
* Making the character move left and right.

Other than these two, I have completed the rest of the part.
### Future prospects:
- A game can be well experienced with a beautiful storyline and cutscenes. So I think adding cutscenes to the game would be useful 
- Adding enemy character with a good algorithm to chase the player to make the game more enjoyable.
### User Manual
The player controls the game play using particular keys on the keyboard. The different
movements of the mouse and camera controls available for the player are listed below.
##### Direction Keys:
- Key ‘w’: Move the mouse forward
- Key ‘s’: Move the mouse backward
- Mouse: Changes the view angle of the scene

##### Other:
- Key ‘p’: To pause the game
- Key 'e' : To open a nearby chest
